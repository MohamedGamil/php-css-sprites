PHP CSS Sprites Generator
===

Can be used as a tool, or a library. Anyways, this thing is capable of:

+ Automatically create CSS Sprites, including CSS Code (duh).
+ Automatically generate friendly CSS Class Names, using given base name, plus file names.
+ Automatically handle different image sizes in the same sprite.
+ Generate SCSS Ready to use code.
+ Generate HTML Demo page, so you can check the output.
+ Nice indented syntax EVERYWHERE in the code (generated code too).
+ You can throw at it pretty much anything, and it will do the job.
+ Works perfectly with Icon Sets.


## Quick start

+ Download / Fork / Clone.
+ Move it somewhere on your localhost, where it can work.
+ Put your images in `./set/` directory, and Run.
+ Voil√†! Sprites generated in no time.
